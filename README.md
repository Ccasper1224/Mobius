## Discord.py has discontinued it's support forcing this project to be scrapped.
Reason can be read here: https://gist.github.com/Rapptz/4a2f62751b9600a31a0d3c78100287f1
This project is being archived and replaced with Mobius.js

>
> - **Mobius** is a core framework recreation of **MODUS**.
> - It uses better code, better practices and open source!

>***My time is still very limited and development might be quite slow.***
